1) What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?

// The most challenging part about the assignment for me was that there was no basic structure to use, unlike some other parts of other assignments. 
// In other words, most of it was up to me. So, what I did was define everything I felt I needed, after looking at the other documents. That's also
// what made it challenging, as at times I'd find myself defining things I didn't need. This assignment took me a lot longer because of it. I solved
// these problems eventually through trial and error, and constantly redefining the constants I'd set. 

2) What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?

// I learned how to shortcut certain processes through variable definitions. What I found I already knew was how to get the filtering to work and 
// comparing the inputs with the posts. 

3) What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?

// The most useful resource was Google. I found that I was struggling too much with finding what a certain command did, or struggle to remember how
// it worked. Other resources were not very helpful, in my opinion. A longer assigment like this has TAs take everything in their own direction,
// and when I tried meeting with multiple different TAs, I found that my code struggled as a result. I had to experiment with my own work. 

4) What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?

// One thing I'd completely forgotten for some reason was "alert." I was wondering how to get an error message to pop up if the fields in the filter
// section weren't correct or valid. Another thing I had to google was Event Listener applications, as I'm still not too well-versed with it.
